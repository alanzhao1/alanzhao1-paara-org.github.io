# Membership Information and Badges

## Membership History

PAARA membership has fluctuated over the years, but might be larger now than it ever has been. According to the January 1, 1973 membership roster for the Palo Alto Amateur Radio Association (W6OTX) and Menlo Park Civil Defense Radio Club (K6YQT), which integrated themselves many years ago, the club had 70 members, including some who are still (or again) members: Dean Babcock, W6OEB; Andy Korsak, VE3FZK/W6; and John A. Cameron III (no callsign).

Today, the Palo Alto Amateur Radio Association consists of nearly 200 members, and is one of the oldest amateur radio clubs in California.
