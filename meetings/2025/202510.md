# October Monthly Meeting

* **Date**: `Oct 3, 2025`
* **Time**: `07:00 PM Pacific Time`
* **Topic**: `Building a Station for Satellite & EME Contacts`
* **Presenter**: `Justin Giorgi, AI6YM`

## Details
Part how-to, part post-mortem. In this talk I’ll take you through building a VHF/UHF station capable of making contacts over satellite repeaters and transponders. It’s not as hard as you think and you probably have the gear already! From your first contact over the Karman line to a moon-bounce mega-station, I’ll walk you through the upgrades, design considerations, and pitfalls. 

Those that came to [Field Day](/fieldday/2025.html){:target="_blank"} know that I fell into many of those pitfalls myself. I’ll go over the successes, the challenges, and (most importantly) the lessons learned building a station for PAARA Field Day.

**Bio:** Justin (<https://ai6ym.radio/>{:target="_blank"}) is a serial tinkerer and jack of all trades (master of none). His projects aren’t meant to be successful by any traditional definition, they’re meant to be educational and entertaining.
